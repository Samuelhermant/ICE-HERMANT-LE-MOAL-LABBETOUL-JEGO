Chapter = K5 - Kokko Chapter 5 - Optimal Foraging

We worked together on the script. We invited ourselves in a workplace and worked in the same room. We helped each other when the script did not work.
For the commenting part, everyone commented on the script and talked to each other about what we didn’t understand.
After trying to understand the topic of dynamic optimisation and the OCTAVE code of optimal foraging, we matched our different competences for this UE. The ones who were better for scripting in python explained how it works, we tried the code line after line where there are some errors. Everyone had a task and did it well. We truly feel that each member understands the coding tools and the script’s mechanisms.
(Special thanks to the team for Samuel who did the coffee.)
